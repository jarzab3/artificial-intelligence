10/10	Self Marking Sheet
8/10	Solve First Training Problem  	                       You seem to have done a pretty solid system, but you fell
								down on two major obvious points.  First, the path
								needs to return to the start.  So, the first training solution
								is 02130.  Second, you need to actually printout the best
								path.  I really have no idea if you've got the best results,
								but....
		
10/10	Get Optimal Result for All Three Training Problems.    Yes, I think you get the best results.
9/10	Describe Algorithm(s) Used				Your description is pretty solid.  Thanks for the extra maths.
5/10	Quality of Code						This is also a bit of a shame.  You've clearly written some
								good code, but have also failed at some basics.  Functions	
								should fit on one page.  So, your main fucntion at > 100 lines
								is too long.  Break it up.  You also need a comment at the
								beginning of each file and before each function.  You shouldn't
								use variables like i.  Give reasonable names.  The LexicOrder
								file is really light on useful comments. 
10/20	Get Optimal Results for the First Three Tests	        Again, I'm not sure if you've got optimal results for final1 or
								final2 because you haven't given me a path. Final3 takes 
								too long.
20	Get Optimal Results for First Three Tests in under a minute.  You haven't put a timer in so I can't give you points
									here or below.
10	Best system on Fourth Test (Path length times time.)

52/100

It's an interesting solution.  If you'd come to the lab to show me a working system, you would have gotten a few more points
and I'd feel more confident that I didn't give you too much.  For the next course work, make sure you're solving the problem
correctly.  Also fix up your coding style.  None the less, it looks like it's a nice, solution.
